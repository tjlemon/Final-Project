Modeling Disease Spread with SIR Simulation

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I've built the core of SIR simulation model. Right now it asks the user for inputs, validates the inputs, does the day to day calculations
for the susceptible, infected, and recovered groups. I also have some features like vaccination, random variation, and animating plotting using matplotlib.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

My next steps are to start building an actual user interface that is interactive and feels more like a videogame. I also want to see if I can incorporate a geographical
component so the disease spreads across the map instead of just numbers and graphs.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

One problem I had was I didn't realize that I guess Python 3.13 doesn't support matplotlib. This took me longer to figure out than I would like to say but
eventually I did and converted my code to a 3.12 version of idle and then matplotlib ran fine.
