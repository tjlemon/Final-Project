# Read Me

## This is the repository for my final project in CIS 1059

My project is a Pandemic Strategy Game, a Python-based simulation that models disease spread using an SIR-style system, inspired by games like Plague Inc. but redesigned as a turn-based strategy experience. The simulation runs on a grid where infection, recovery, and death happen randomly, and the player uses limited resources to contain the outbreak through vaccines, quarantine zones, and hospitals.

The game is built using Python and Pygame and includes animated transitions, interactive UI menus, sound effects, visual overlays for quarantine and hospital influence areas, and difficulty settings. The player chooses actions each turn while the simulation advances ten days at a time. You win by eliminating all infections, while defeat occurs if the population becomes fully infected or lost.

For this project, I also developed a separate Monte Carlo simulation engine to automatically run hundreds of games using different strategies. This allowed me to see the effectiveness of different playstyles and understand how the disease model behaves under different conditions.

Throughout the building process, I learned how to structure a larger program across multiple files, handle event-driven graphics, design UI components from scratch, debug simulation behavior, and balance probabilistic game mechanics. The project challenged me to combine creativity with technical problem-solving, and I am proud of the final result.

A video walkthrough demonstrating the game is included with this submission:
