## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Disease Spread Simulation (SIR Model)

I want to build a simple simulation of how an infectious

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't

No, unless you have any suggestions that for cool ways to execute this idea.
I'm interested in biostat, so want to do something pertaining to that.
